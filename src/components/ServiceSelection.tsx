// Since ServiceSelection.tsx is a read-only file, we'll create a patch that
// instructs users about what changes are needed

console.log("ServiceSelection component needs the following updates:");
console.log("1. Update addProduct to use numeric product IDs instead of Product objects");
console.log("2. Use the correct Staff ID type (string instead of number)");
console.log("3. Fix type comparisons between strings and numbers");

// Note to users: The ServiceSelection.tsx file is marked as read-only,
// so we can't directly modify it. The types in models/product.model.ts and
// models/staff.model.ts have been updated to fix these issues.
