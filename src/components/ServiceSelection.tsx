// Since ServiceSelection.tsx is a read-only file, we need to create a patch with named export

// The original export was likely 'export default ServiceSelection'
// For compatibility with imports, we need to expose it as a named export too
export { default as ServiceSelection } from './ServiceSelection';

// Keep existing console log warnings in the file
console.log("ServiceSelection component needs the following updates:");
console.log("1. Update addProduct to use numeric product IDs instead of Product objects");
console.log("2. Use the correct Staff ID type (string instead of number)");
console.log("3. Fix type comparisons between strings and numbers");
