Our estheticians use premium products that target your unique skin concerns, whether it's dryness, acne, signs of aging, or sensitivity. The treatment concludes with a relaxing facial massage that improves circulation and enhances the absorption of applied products. You'll leave with glowing, refreshed skin and personalized recommendations for your home skincare routine.",
    longDescription:
      "Our signature facial treatment begins with a detailed consultation to understand your skin concerns and goals. The procedure starts with a gentle cleansing to remove surface impurities, followed by a deeper cleanse to prepare your skin for treatment. Next, our esthetician will perform a careful exfoliation to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reveal fresh skin underneath. Depending on your skin's needs, we may incorporate steam to soften the skin and facilitate extraction of clogged pores. A specialized mask will then be applied to address your specific concerns, whether it's hydration, purification, or anti-aging. During the mask application, you'll enjoy a relaxing hand and arm massage. The treatment concludes with the application of toner, serums, moisturizer, and SPF protection tailored to your skin type. Our specialists will also provide you with personalized skincare recommendations to maintain your results at home.",
