# Feature Module Troubleshooting

This document contains common issues and solutions you might encounter when implementing new features using this template.

## Common Issues

### 1. Type Errors

**Issue**: TypeScript errors when using the feature types

**Solution**: 
- Make sure to update the types in `types.ts` to match your data model
- Check for any required fields that you might have missed
- Look for any imports that might need updating

### 2. Route Conflicts

**Issue**: Routes not working or conflicting with existing routes

**Solution**:
- Ensure route paths in `routes.tsx` are unique
- Check if you have imported the routes correctly in your main routes file
- Verify that any path parameters (like `:id`) match what you're using in your components

### 3. API Integration

**Issue**: API calls not working as expected

**Solution**:
- Update the endpoint in `feature.service.ts` to match your backend API
- Check the response structure and update the type mapping if needed
- Add proper error handling for any specific API errors

### 4. Form Validation

**Issue**: Form validation not working correctly

**Solution**:
- Update the Zod schema in `FeatureForm.tsx` to match your data requirements
- Make sure all required fields are properly validated
- Check if default values are set correctly for edit mode

### 5. Components Not Rendering

**Issue**: Components not showing up as expected

**Solution**:
- Check if you're properly exporting all components in `index.ts`
- Verify that you're importing the components correctly
- Make sure the components are getting the props they need

## Advanced Customization

### Adding Custom Functionality

To add functionality beyond the basics provided in this template:

1. Create new component files in the `components` directory
2. Add new methods to the service class in `feature.service.ts`
3. Create additional hooks in the `hooks` directory
4. Export everything through `index.ts`

### Integration with State Management

If you're using a global state manager (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.):

1. Create a store file in a `store` subdirectory
2. Set up your state slice, actions, and selectors
3. Connect your components to the state
4. Export the store through `index.ts`

Example for Redux:

```tsx
// store/featureSlice.ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const featureSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'features',
  initialState: {
    items: [],
    isLoading: false,
    error: null
  },
  reducers: {
    // Your reducers here
  }
});

// Export actions and reducer
export const { actions } = featureSlice;
export default featureSlice.reducer;
```

## Performance Optimizations

If your feature deals with large amounts of data:

1. Add pagination to your list component
2. Implement virtualization for long lists
3. Add memoization to expensive computations
4. Use the `React.memo` HOC for components that render frequently

## Accessibility

Ensure your components are accessible:

1. Use proper ARIA attributes
2. Ensure keyboard navigation works
3. Test with screen readers
4. Maintain proper contrast ratios
